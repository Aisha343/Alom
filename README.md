# Alom
#### Reversing of the protected "Protector" [alomencoder.obfs.php](https://github.com/avid0/Alom/blob/main/alomencoder.obfs.php).

### 2.2 Bypass Anti Debug
- Modify your XDebug configuration to my own.
Note: The bypass is due to a bad anti debug setup and we can bypass it by changing `xdebug.remote_enable`, `xdebug.remote_autostart`, `xdebug.profiler_enable` and trick the anti debug into believing XDebug is not enabled.
```ini
xdebug.start_with_request = yes;
xdebug.remote_enable = 0
xdebug.remote_autostart = 0
xdebug.profiler_enable = 0
xdebug.auto_trace = 1
xdebug.collect_params = 4
xdebug.collect_return = 1
xdebug.collect_vars = 1
xdebug.cli_color = 1
xdebug.show_local_vars = 1
xdebug.scream = false
xdebug.discover_client_host = true
xdebug.mode = develop,debug,profile
zend_extension = "C:\PHP\ext\php_xdebug.dll"
```
- Put the breakpoint as seen on the guide for the version [2.1](#21-gzinflate-bp-vulnerability)
- Now the tricky part is to get the `$code` which contains the real code, It is hidden between multiple `gzinflate` calls so we will need to go in and out of each call in order to find the hidden and truely decoded `$code`.

### 2.1 `gzinflate` BP Vulnerability
- Add breakpoint at call of `gzinflate`
- Start debugging
- Once it hit the breakpoint a second time step in until you see the evaluated variable named `$code` there should be your unprotected code.

### 1.8 `__FILE__` Vulnerability
- Make backup of the original protected code `alomencoder.obfs.php` => `back.php`.
- Replace `__FILE__` by the backup file name e.g `back.php`.
- Removing all code bellow the decompressing and loading of the `AlomDecoder` class.
```php
if (!class_exists('AlomDecoder')) {
    _nZGueubW86A4Fdf412697615(gzinflate(base64_decode(file_get_contents(_s7GdHhyCWB0FOmT412697615(base64_decode('YWxvbWRlY29kZXIub2Jmcy5waHA='))))));
}

// Remove all code bellow
AlomDecoder::mt_prng_store(rand());
AlomDecoder::run( ... )
```
- Echo or debug the file in order to get the content from the compressed `AlomDecoder` class.
```php 
if (!class_exists('AlomDecoder')) {
    echo(gzinflate(base64_decode(file_get_contents(_s7GdHhyCWB0FOmT412697615(base64_decode('YWxvbWRlY29kZXIub2Jmcy5waHA='))))));
}
```
- By executing the code it should now return the `AlomDecoder` class.
- Once you got the `AlomDecoder` class remove all code and paste the class.
- Bellow the class include the backup file so it loads and overwrite the execution from its own `AlomDecoder` class.
```php
class AlomDecoder {
	...
}

include('back.php');
```
- Now you are set and you can change/view the decryption routine.
- To obtain the unprotected code you'll need to edit the `AlomDecoder` class and change the variable `$_ALOM_code` which is getting executed within the `run` function.
```php
public static function run($code) {
...
	(function ($_ALOM_code) {
	    foreach ($GLOBALS as $_ALOM_key => $_ALOM_val) $$_ALOM_key =& $GLOBALS[$_ALOM_key];
	    unset($_ALOM_key);
	    unset($_ALOM_val);
	    echo $_ALOM_code; // Display it
	    file_put_contents('unpacked.php', $_ALOM_code); // Save it
	    eval($_ALOM_code); // Here the unprotected code gets executed
	    if (isset($_ALOM_code)) {
	        $_ALOM_code = NULL;
	        unset($_ALOM_code);
	    }
	    AlomDecoder::$tmpvars = get_defined_vars();
	})("\$_ALOM_code='';unset(\$_ALOM_code);$code;" . ($code = ''));
...
}
```
